Thank you for downloading "Caught in the middle half of a mountain"!

INSTRUCTIONS

- Create a new folder and call it “Caught in the middle of a mountain”
  or something similar that you’ll remember

- Drag the .zip file into the folder then use WinRar or 7zip to unzip it.
  Personally I recommend 7zip. DO NOT USE ANYTHING FROM THE
  WINDOWS APP STORE, THEY DO NOT WORK

- Double click the .bat to run the game

- Enjoy!


OPTIONAL
If you want to create a desktop shortcut simply right click the "run.bat" file,
then press “create shortcut” or a button that says something similar and then
drag that to your desktop and your finished.
